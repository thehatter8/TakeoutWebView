# TakeoutWebView
Uses Google Takeout data to generate a webmap of visited locations using Leaflet.js, Flask, Python3, OpenStreetMap and whatever else I forgot to mention. Accepts 2-column [latitude, longitude\] CSV or JSON from Google Takeout. If you want to combine all your takeout data into a single file, consider using my other project [GMapsJSONtoCSV](https://github.com/thehatter8/GMapsJSONtoCSV/) which gives you 2-column CSV and a combined PrimaryOutput.json using all your Takeout data


# Building - under construction
* basically, put the files somewhere and add an uploads folder
* apt install screen if not already installed
* pip install flask werkzeug | should be everything you need there
* ./start-server.sh
